To-dos
======

* Create a gRPC service with a JSON-to-gRPC reverse proxy
* Generalize the reverse proxy so we can just build that image once.
  Consider including that as a sidecar or a standalone service.
* Create a nice landing page for users of the API
* Concatenate all of the OpenAPI specs so we can auto-generate libraries
* Create scaffolding
